## YCombinator Web Scraper
Used Selenium to webscrape and control the webpage to continue scrolling down to the end as the page was dynamically loaded. Found the number of startups in each YC cohort and then identified the percentage of which had the GenAI tag. This was then comapred with a 'control group' being the Healthcare tag which is thought to be a relativley steady industry. 

Results were then visualised.

## Quarterly Earnings Analysis
Finished analysis for Microsoft which was used as a benchmark to compare other companies' Generative AI revenue performances. Selenium was used to scrape through each quarterly report, identify earnings categories and to collate data from 2018 onwards.

## Startup Revenue Classification
Created a custom pyramid visualisation from given data for an internal pitch meeting.
