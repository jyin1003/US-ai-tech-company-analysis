## YCombinator Web Scraper
Used Selenium to webscrape as the page was dynamically loaded. Found the number of startups in each YC cohort and then identified the percentage of which had the GenAI tag. This was then comapred with a 'control group' being the Healthcare tag which is thought to be a relativley steady industry.
